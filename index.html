                <p>My name is Scott Chow, and I am going to show you how to start blogging today. I have been building blogs and websites since 2002. In that time I have launched several of my own blogs, and helped hundreds of others do the same.<br><br>
I know that starting a blog can seem overwhelming and intimidating. <span class="bold">This free guide is all about blogging for beginners,</span> and will teach you how to become a blogger with just the most basic computer skills. So whether you're 8 or 88, you can create your own blog in 20 minutes.<br><br>
I am not ashamed to admit that when I was first learning how to build a blog I made a ton of mistakes. You can benefit from more than a decade of my experience so that you don’t repeat these same mistakes when you make your own blog. I created this free guide so that a complete beginner can learn how to blog quickly and easily.<br><br>
<span class="italic">So, just how do you start a blog?</span><br><br>
Learn how to create a blog in about 20 minutes following these steps:<br><br>

            <h3>Should you start a blog?</h3>
            <p>
                One of the misconceptions about starting a blog is that you need to be a great writer to be successful. Nothing could be further from the truth. People read blog sites to get a personal perspective on things, so most bloggers write in a very informal and conversational style. <br><br>
And because of the format, many successful bloggers will <span class="bold">write about a variety of topics</span> on the same blog.<br><br>
In addition, you don't need to be an expert on any of the topics you write about to have a successful blog. For example, visitors to a cooking blog don't want to read a textbook from a food scientist, they want to hear the experiences of someone who has actually cooked some real meals, mistakes and all.<br><br>
<span class="bold">To be successful as a blogger there is really just one requirement: a passion for your topic.</span><br><br>
At its heart, blogging is about sharing your knowledge with the world. Writing about things that you are passionate about makes the process of starting a successful blog so much easier. As long as you are writing about things that you are genuinely interested in, your passion will shine through and keep your visitors interested.<br><br>
So why would you go to the trouble of blogging? There are a few reasons:<br><br>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="bold">Share your story.</span> A blog allows you to have a voice and be heard. You can share your story with the entire world if you so choose. One of the most common ways blogs are used are as a diary where the blogger writes about their daily experiences so that friends, family, and others can all be a part of their lives.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Make money from home.</span> Blogging can be quite lucrative if done correctly. The top bloggers in the world obviously earn quite a bit, but even a part-time blogger can expect to make a nice profit if things are done correctly. The best part about it is that blogging is a form of passive income, since you can spend just a few hours a week writing a piece of content and then continue to profit from it long after the the writing is finished. I go into much more detail on how to blog for money later in this guide.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Recognition for yourself or your business.</span> No, you probably won't have paparazzi following you around because of your latest post. But a successful blog makes your idea into a reality, and can gain you a ton of recognition in your respective field. Many bloggers are known as experts just because of their blogs, and some have even gotten book and movie deals based on their blogs.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Find a community.</span> Blogging at its heart is interactive. You write a post and people comment on it. This is a good way to connect with people who are interested in the same things as you are. Blogging allows you to teach these people based on your experience, and it gives you the opportunity to learn from your readers as well.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What is a blog anyway?</h3>

            <p>
                In short, <span class="bold">a blog is a type of website that focuses mainly on written content,</span> also known as blog posts. In popular culture we most often hear about news blogs or celebrity blog sites, but as you'll see in this guide, you can start a successful blog on just about any topic imaginable.<br><br>
Bloggers often write from a personal perspective that allows them to connect directly with their readers. In addition, most blogs also have a “comments” section where visitors can correspond with the blogger. Interacting with your visitors in the comments section helps to further the connection between the blogger and the reader.<br><br>
This direct connection to the reader is one of the main benefits of starting a blog. This connection allows you to interact and share ideas with other like-minded people. It also allows you to build trust with your readers. Having the trust and loyalty of your readers also opens up the door to making money from your blog, which is something I discuss later in this guide.<br><br>
The good news is that the internet is exploding with growth right now. More people than ever are online. This explosion in growth means more potential readers for your blog. In short, if you are thinking about starting a blog then there is no better time than right now.<br><br>
Let's start your blog!<br><br>
            </p>

            <h2>Step 2: Get your blog online</h2>
            <p>Now that you've got a name picked out it's time to get your blog online. This might sound hard or technical, but the steps below will walk you right through and <span class="italic">make the process easy.</span></p>
            <div class="float-img">
                <img src="images/start-your-first-blog.png" alt="How to Create">
            </div>
            <p>To get your blog up and running you need two things: blog hosting (also known as web hosting) and blogging software. The good news is that these typically come packaged together. <br><br>
A blog host is a company that stores all of the files for your blog and delivers them to the user when they type in your blog name. <span class="bold">You must have a blog host in order to have a blog.</span><br><br>
You also need to have the software to build your blog. In this guide I will be showing you how to build a blog using the WordPress blogging software, because it is the most popular, customizable, and easiest to use.

            <section class="collapsibles-sect">
                <h3 class="collapsible-head-link">What makes a successful blog?</h3>
                <div class="collapsible-content">
                    <p>You. It is your passion, your creativity, your knowledge and expertise, and what you bring to the community that makes a blog successful. As long as you provide content that is interesting, informative, and engaging to the readers you're looking to connect with, your success is only limited by the number of posts you're able to produce. <br><br>
                        Keep writing, keep interacting, keep engaging, and your blog quickly become one of the success stories. As long as you're passionate about the subject matter, the sky is the limit.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <h3 class="collapsible-head-link">What do you need to start a blog?</h3>
                <div class="collapsible-content">
                    <p>Time, passion, and a clear goal. <br><br>
                        Blogging is nearly a full-time operation. A successful blogger commits to posting lengthy and detailed content at least weekly. Promoting the blog must also be done regularly across social accounts and through peer interactions.<br><br>
                        Equally important is the passion behind your blog. To come up with great content on a regular basis your blog should revolve around a topic that you are obsessed with. You don’t have to be the leading authority on the subject matter. You only need to possess passion, excitement, dedication, and deeply rooted opinions.<br><br>
                        You also need a clear goal in mind. What is the main objective of your blog? Is it to inform the public? To eventually retain paid subscribers? With a clear final objective you can grow a blog that satisfies these goals in the long term.<br><br>

                        Thanks for the valuable information. I'm concerned about the usage of images/licenses. <br>
                        Can we use creative commons images in our blogs if we are unable to take the photos ourselves? There's a filter on Google when image searching for “Commercial” and then “Creative Commons” images and wondering which is the safest bet of images to use on a blog. Don't want to get in trouble!
